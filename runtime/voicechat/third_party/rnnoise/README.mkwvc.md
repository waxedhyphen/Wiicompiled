# RNNoise

Vendored runtime sources and built-in speech model from Xiph RNNoise v0.2, commit `904a876dce1f9ab8860c0a5000ed151f9f6eef58`:

`CMakeLists.txt` is the project's static-library build adapter. Upstream copyright notices, AUTHORS and COPYING are retained. No model download, Python runtime or online service is needed by the voice client.

AudioProcessor passes 48 kHz mono floating-point PCM in the original int16 amplitude range, in 480-sample blocks. Suppression runs after the existing capture processing and final microphone gain. At partial strength the dry path is delayed by the same 960 samples as RNNoise before mixing; 0% and disabled remain exact immediate bypasses. The VAD return value does not gate or mute speech.

RNNoise is warmed once before microphone processing starts. Each processor owns independent recurrent state and fixed-size input/output buffers.

The full quantized model comes from https://media.xiph.org/rnnoise/models/rnnoise_data-0b50c45.tar.gz (SHA-256 `4ac81c5c0884ec4bd5907026aaae16209b7b76cd9d7f71af582094a2f98f4b43`). Only the optional `#ifndef DISABLE_DEBUG_FLOAT` duplicate debugging arrays have been removed from `rnnoise_data.c`; the build defines `DISABLE_DEBUG_FLOAT` and all production model weights are unchanged. `tools/prepare_rnnoise_model.py` reproduces this transformation from the upstream model source. No other upstream runtime source is modified.
